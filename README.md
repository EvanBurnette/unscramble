# Unscrambler

## What is this?

An app completely ruins the fun of the popular newspaper game "Jumble".

## Why would you do this?

I'm a self taught full stack software engineer. I got stuck on a Jumble. This reminded me of a competetive programming problem and I thought it would be a good problem to learn some prolog which I had heard about on a podcast. I was cleaning and preparing the data with javascript when I realized I could probably just complete the program completely in javascript.

The original program was written just for node.js and only worked on the final part of the puzzle, the phrase solving. This new version unscrambles individual words and the phrase. I'm using it as a small project to learn about webworkers and work a bit on my UI design. The original program only ran on node.js and used the python style workers that come with node.
